# QR Code Detection on Metal Surfaces

This project is an image processing solution designed to detect QR codes, even on challenging surfaces such as metal. It leverages advanced algorithms to ensure accurate detection and decoding of QR codes under various conditions.

## Features

- **Robust Detection**: Capable of detecting QR codes on reflective and metallic surfaces.
- **High Accuracy**: Optimized for precision in decoding QR codes.
- **Versatile**: Works with a variety of image inputs and lighting conditions.

## Prerequisites

Before using this solution, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (e.g., OpenCV, NumPy)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd EASE
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place the image files to be processed in the designated input folder.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. The detected QR codes and their data will be displayed in the console or saved to the output folder.

## Example

Here is an example of how the solution works:
